particular the tests folder About This is a draft for demo purposes. It is a LinkML rendering of the GO-CAM schema. The only thing that is edited is the gocam.yaml file in the src/schema folder. Various artefacts are generated: Python dataclasses JSON-Schema GraphQL ShEx (but see notes below) JSON-LD context More will be generated in future, e.g. SQL DDL, APIs, grcl queries Python Datamodel Here we show an example of using the Python object model to create a portion of Figure3 , specifically this fragment: WNT_SIGNALING = 'GO:0060070' ## canonical Wnt signaling pathway RECEPTOR_LIGAND = 'GO:0048018' ## receptor ligand activity RECEPTOR_ACTIVITY = 'GO:0042813' ## Wnt-activated receptor activity EXTRACELLULAR = 'GO:0005615' ## extracellular space PM = 'GO:0005886' ## plasma membrane WNT3 = 'UniprotKB:P56703' FZD1 = 'UniprotKB:Q9UP38' m = Model(id=id('m1'), title='test title', contributor=['orcid:123', 'orcid:234'], state=ModelStateEnum.production) print(f'Model = {m.id}') p1 = BiologicalProcess(id=id('p1'), type=WNT_SIGNALING) c1 = AnatomicalEntity(id=id('c1'), type=EXTRACELLULAR, category=AnatomicalEntityCategory.CellularAnatomicalEntity) c2 = AnatomicalEntity(id=id('c2'), type=PM, category=AnatomicalEntityCategory.CellularAnatomicalEntity) g1 = InformationBiomacromolecule(id=id('g1'), type=WNT3, category=InformationBiomacromoleculeCategory.GeneOrReferenceProtein) g2 = InformationBiomacromolecule(id=id('g2'), type=FZD1, category=InformationBiomacromoleculeCategory.GeneOrReferenceProtein) a2 = MolecularActivity(id=id('a2'), type=RECEPTOR_ACTIVITY, enabled_by=EnabledByAssociation(object=g2.id), occurs_in=OccursInAssociation(object=c2.id), part_of=ProcessPartOfAssociation(object=p1.id)) a1 = MolecularActivity(id=id('a1'), type=RECEPTOR_LIGAND, enabled_by=EnabledByAssociation(object=g1.id), occurs_in=OccursInAssociation(object=c1.id), causes=CausesAssociation(predicate='regulates', object=id('a2'))) m.molecular_activity_set = [a1, a2] m.information_biomacromolecule_set = [g1, g2] jsonld = dumps(m, cntxt) print(jsonld) Of course, one would generally not write code like this - to obtain python objects we would use an adapter to get from files/database, or it would sit at the end of a CRUD API. The code above is just for illustration purposes. JSON Serialization See the jsonschema folder in GitHub, but note that the JSON-Schema is generated from the LinkML Additionally, conversion from Pythjon objects to JSON-Schema with appropriate inlining is handled automatically Models The model contains basic metadata, it also is a holder for various sets of GO-CAM entities: { \"id\": \"model:m1\", \"title\": \"test title\", \"contributor\": [ \"orcid:123\", \"orcid:234\" ], \"state\": { \"text\": \"production\" }, \"molecular_activity_set\": [ ...], \"biological_process_set\": [ ...], \"information_biomacromolecule_set\": [ ...], ... } See the Model class in the schema docs Basic \"Annoton\" A molecular activity corresponds identically to the model in the paper. In the JSON serialization we inline each relationship for convenience: \"molecular_activity_set\": [ { \"id\": \"model:a1\", \"type\": \"GO:0048018\", \"causes\": { \"object\": \"model:a2\", \"has_evidence\": { \"id\": \"model:e6\", \"evidence_type\": \"ECO:nnn\", \"reference\": [ \"PMID:1234\" ] }, \"predicate\": \"regulates\" }, \"enabled_by\": { \"object\": \"model:g1\", \"has_evidence\": { \"id\": \"model:e4\", \"evidence_type\": \"ECO:nnn\", \"reference\": [ \"PMID:1234\" ] } }, \"occurs_in\": { \"object\": \"model:c1\", \"has_evidence\": { \"id\": \"model:e5\", \"evidence_type\": \"ECO:nnn\", \"reference\": [ \"PMID:1234\" ] } } }, Differences from current RDF/OWL and go-cam-shapes.shex Although this model has a direct JSON-LD/RDF serialization via LinkML there are some differences (note also that this repo contains auto-generated ShEx from this model which will naturally differ) Adherence to original specification This model aims to be simple and to serve as a substrate for programmatic exchange, APIs, serialization. The ShEx contains many additional classes that are useful for validation according to specific GO BPs and MFs, but we leave these out of this model. GO-CAM entities are explicitly part of a model The top level object is a Model, which in addition to holding metadata (title etc), is a holder for all of the different GO-CAM elements: { \"id\": \"model:m1\", \"title\": \"test title\", \"contributor\": [ \"orcid:123\", \"orcid:234\" ], \"state\": { \"text\": \"production\" }, \"molecular_activity_set\": [ { \"id\": \"model:a1\", \"type\": \"GO:0048018\", \"causes\": { \"object\": \"model:a2\", \"predicate\": \"regulates\" }, \"enabled_by\": { \"object\": \"model:g1\" }, \"occurs_in\": { \"object\": \"model:c1\" } }, { \"id\": \"model:a2\", \"type\": \"GO:0042813\", \"part_of\": { \"object\": \"model:p1\" }, \"enabled_by\": { \"object\": \"model:g2\" }, \"occurs_in\": { \"object\": \"model:c2\" } } ], \"information_biomacromolecule_set\": [ { \"id\": \"model:g1\", \"type\": \"UniprotKB:P56703\", \"category\": \"GeneOrReferenceProtein\" }, Reification This model uses RDF reification for simplicity for now, not OWL annotation","title":"Home"},{"location":"home/#introduction","text":"This is a draft schema for GO-CAMs for demo purposes","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"home/#links","text":"https://cmungall.github.io/linkml-gocam/ https://github.com/cmungall/linkml-gocam See in particular the tests folder","title":"Links"},{"location":"home/#about","text":"This is a draft for demo purposes.
