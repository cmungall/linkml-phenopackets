Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := anypb.New(foo) if err != nil { ... } ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". JSON ==== The JSON representation of an Any value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field @type which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field value which holds the custom JSON in addition to the @type field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" } Biosample A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g. sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted. Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation. Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g. genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.

This is a bundle of high-level concepts with no specifically defined relational concepts. It is expected that the resources sharing the phenopackets will define and enforce their own semantics and level of requirements for included fields.

By preference a single concept to indicate both the procedure and the body site should be used. In cases where this is not possible, the body site should be indicated using a separate ontology class. e.g. {\"code\":{\"NCIT:C51585\": \"Biopsy of Soft Palate\"}} {\"code\":{\"NCIT:C28743\": \"Punch Biopsy\"}, \"body_site\":{\"UBERON:0003403\": \"skin of forearm\"}} - a punch biopsy of the skin from the forearm FHIR mapping: Procedure (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html) Quantity RadiationTherapy RadiationTherapy ReferenceRange RepeatedSequenceExpression Resource Description of an external resource used for referencing an object.

The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a 24-hour linear smear . The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings. # Examples Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX time() .

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := anypb.New(foo) if err != nil { ... } ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". JSON ==== The JSON representation of an Any value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field @type which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field value which holds the custom JSON in addition to the @type field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" } _ URI: any:Any classDiagram class Any Any : typeUrl Any : value Slots Name Cardinality and Range Description typeUrl 0..1 xsd:string A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized proto... value 0..1 Value Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type Usages Identifier and Mapping Information Mappings Mapping Type Mapped Value self ['any:Any'] native ['any:Any'] LinkML Specification Direct name: Any description: '`Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ...

JSON ==== The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.

The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.)

If a phenopacket is being used to describe one member of a cohort, then in general one phenopacket will be created for each of the individuals in the cohort. from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/phenopackets rank: 1000 multivalued: true alias: relatives owner: Family domain_of: - Family range: Phenopacket","title":"Induced"},{"location":"Feature/","text":"Class: Feature URI: vrs:Feature classDiagram class Feature Feature : gene Slots Name Cardinality and Range Description gene 0..1 GeneDescriptor Usages Identifier and Mapping Information Rules Mappings Mapping Type Mapped Value self ['vrs:Feature'] native ['vrs:Feature'] LinkML Specification Direct name: Feature description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs rank: 1000 attributes: gene: name: gene annotations: rank: tag: rank value: '1' description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs range: Gene rules: - postconditions: exactly_one_of: - slot_conditions: gene: name: gene required: true Induced name: Feature description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs rank: 1000 attributes: gene: name: gene annotations: rank: tag: rank value: '1' description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs alias: gene owner: Feature domain_of: - GenomicInterpretation - CopyNumber - Feature range: GeneDescriptor rules: - postconditions: exactly_one_of: - slot_conditions: gene: name: gene required: true","title":"Class: Feature"},{"location":"Feature/#class-feature","text":"URI: vrs:Feature classDiagram class Feature Feature : gene","title":"Class: Feature"},{"location":"Feature/#slots","text":"Name Cardinality and Range Description gene 0..1 GeneDescriptor","title":"Slots"},{"location":"Feature/#usages","text":"","title":"Usages"},{"location":"Feature/#identifier-and-mapping-information","text":"","title":"Identifier and Mapping Information"},{"location":"Feature/#rules","text":"","title":"Rules"},{"location":"Feature/#mappings","text":"Mapping Type Mapped Value self ['vrs:Feature'] native ['vrs:Feature']","title":"Mappings"},{"location":"Feature/#linkml-specification","text":"","title":"LinkML Specification"},{"location":"Feature/#direct","text":"name: Feature description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs rank: 1000 attributes: gene: name: gene annotations: rank: tag: rank value: '1' description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs range: Gene rules: - postconditions: exactly_one_of: - slot_conditions: gene: name: gene required: true","title":"Direct"},{"location":"Feature/#induced","text":"name: Feature description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs rank: 1000 attributes: gene: name: gene annotations: rank: tag: rank value: '1' description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/vrs alias: gene owner: Feature domain_of: - GenomicInterpretation - CopyNumber - Feature range: GeneDescriptor rules: - postconditions: exactly_one_of: - slot_conditions: gene: name: gene required: true","title":"Induced"},{"location":"File/","text":"Class: File URI: base:File classDiagram class File File : fileAttributes File : individualToFileIdentifiers File : uri Slots Name Cardinality and Range Description fileAttributes 0..1 Dictionary Map of attributes describing the file individualToFileIdentifiers 0..1 Dictionary A map of identifiers mapping an individual to a sample in the file uri 0..1 xsd:string URI for the file e Usages used by used in type used Cohort files range File Family files range File Phenopacket files range File Biosample files range File Identifier and Mapping Information Mappings Mapping Type Mapped Value self ['base:File'] native ['base:File'] LinkML Specification Direct name: File description: '' from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/phenopackets/base rank: 1000 attributes: fileAttributes: name: fileAttributes annotations: rank: tag: rank value: '3' description: Map of attributes describing the file.

The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset). For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017. In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard toISOString() method.

Instant now = Instant.now(); Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond()) .setNanos(now.getNano()).build(); Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python. timestamp = Timestamp() timestamp.GetCurrentTime() # JSON Mapping In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the format is \"{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z\" where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day}, {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution), are optional. The \"Z\" suffix indicates the timezone (\"UTC\"); the timezone is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by \"Z\") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset). For example, \"2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z\" encodes 15.01 seconds past 01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017. In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the standard [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString) method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted to this format using [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with the time format spec ''%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ''. Likewise, in Java, one can use the Joda Time''s [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`]( http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime%2D%2D ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
