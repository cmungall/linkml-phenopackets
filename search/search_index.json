Equivalent to the Genomics England InterpretationRequestRD https://github.com/genomicsengland/GelReportModels/blob/master/schemas/IDLs/org.gel.models.report.avro/5.0.0/InterpretationRequestRD.avdl Phenopacket An anonymous phenotypic description of an individual or biosample with potential genes of interest and/or diagnoses. This is a bundle of high-level concepts with no specifically defined relational concepts. It is expected that the resources sharing the phenopackets will define and enforce their own semantics and level of requirements for included fields. PhenotypicFeature An individual phenotypic feature, observed as either present or absent (negated), with possible onset, modifiers and frequency FHIR mapping: Condition (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition.html) or Observation (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html) Age See http://build.fhir.org/datatypes and http://build.fhir.org/condition-definitions.html#Condition.onset_x_ In FHIR this is represented as a UCUM measurement - http://unitsofmeasure.org/trac/ AgeRange Dictionary None Evidence FHIR mapping: Condition.evidence (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/condition-definitions.html#Condition.evidence) ExternalReference FHIR mapping: Reference (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/references.html) File GestationalAge OntologyClass A class (aka term, concept) in an ontology. FHIR mapping: CodeableConcept (http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#CodeableConcept) see also Coding (http://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Coding) Procedure A clinical procedure performed on a subject. By preference a single concept to indicate both the procedure and the body site should be used. In cases where this is not possible, the body site should be indicated using a separate ontology class. e.g. {\"code\":{\"NCIT:C51585\": \"Biopsy of Soft Palate\"}} {\"code\":{\"NCIT:C28743\": \"Punch Biopsy\"}, \"body_site\":{\"UBERON:0003403\": \"skin of forearm\"}} - a punch biopsy of the skin from the forearm FHIR mapping: Procedure (https://www.hl7.org/fhir/procedure.html) TimeElement TimeInterval Timestamp Protocol Buffers - Google's data interchange format Copyright 2008 Google Inc.

A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a 24-hour linear smear . The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings. # Examples Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX time() . Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0); Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX gettimeofday() . struct timeval tv; gettimeofday(&tv, NULL); Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000); Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() . FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) Pedigree https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11016 Person Individual An individual (or subject) typically corresponds to an individual human or another organism.

Any contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := anypb.New(foo) if err != nil { ... } ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". JSON ==== The JSON representation of an Any value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field @type which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field value which holds the custom JSON in addition to the @type field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" } Disease Message to indicate a disease (diagnosis) and its recorded onset. Biosample A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g. sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted. Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation. Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g. genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample. FHIR mapping: Specimen (http://www.hl7.org/fhir/specimen.html). Slots Slot Description description files Pointer to relevant file(s) for the cohort. Files relating exclusively to individual phenopackets should be contained in the Phenopacket. id members metaData Structured definitions of the resources and ontologies used within the phenopacket. REQUIRED consanguinousParents flag to indicate that the parents of the proband are consanguinous pedigree The pedigree defining the relations between the proband and their relatives. Pedigree.individual_id should map to the PhenoPacket.Individual.id proband The individual representing the focus of this packet - e.g. the proband in rare disease cases or cancer patient relatives Individuals related in some way to the patient. For instance, the individuals may be genetically related or may be members of a cohort. If this field is used, then it is expected that a pedigree will be included for genetically related individuals for use cases such as genomic diagnostics. If a phenopacket is being used to describe one member of a cohort, then in general one phenopacket will be created for each of the individuals in the cohort. biosamples Biosample(s) derived from the patient or a collection of biosamples in isolation diseases Field for disease identifiers - could be used for listing either diagnosed or suspected conditions. The resources using these fields should define what this represents in their context. interpretations measurements Quantifiable measurements related to the individual medicalActions phenotypicFeatures Phenotypic features relating to the subject of the phenopacket subject The individual representing the focus of this packet - e.g. the proband in rare disease cases or cancer patient evidence Evidences for how the phenotype was determined. excluded Flag to indicate whether the phenotype was observed or not. Default is 'false', in other words the phenotype was observed. Therefore it is only required in cases to indicate that the phenotype was looked for, but found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates the logical negation of the OntologyClass used in the 'type' field. CAUTION It is imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the phenotype! modifiers subclasses of HP:0012823 ! Clinical modifier apart from Severity HP:0012824 - Severity onset the values of this will come from the HPO onset hierarchy i.e. subclasses of HP:0003674 FHIR mapping: Condition.onset resolution severity Severity of the condition e.g. subclasses of HP:0012824-Severity or SNOMED:272141005-Severities FHIR mapping: Condition.severity type The primary ontology class which describes the phenotype. For example \"HP:0001363\" \"Craniosynostosis\" FHIR mapping: Condition.identifier iso8601duration The :ref: ISO 8601<metadata_date_time> age of this object as ISO8601 duration or time intervals. e.g. P40Y10M05D) end start evidenceCode The encoded evidence type using, for example the Evidence & Conclusion Ontology (ECO - http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/eco.owl) FHIR mapping: Condition.evidence.code reference FHIR mapping: Condition.evidence.detail fileAttributes Map of attributes describing the file. For example the File format or genome assembly would be defied here. For genomic data files there MUST be a 'genomeAssembly' key. individualToFileIdentifiers A map of identifiers mapping an individual to a sample in the file. The key values must correspond to the Individual::id for the individuals in the message, the values must map to the samples in the file. uri URI for the file e.g. file://data/genomes/file1.vcf.gz or https://opensnp.org/data/60.23andme-exome-vcf.231?1341012444 days weeks label class label, aka name. E.g. \"Abnormality of cardiovascular system\" bodySite FHIR mapping: Procedure.bodySite code FHIR mapping: Procedure.code performed When the procedure was performed. age ageRange gestationalAge interval ontologyClass timestamp nanos Non-negative fractions of a second at nanosecond resolution. Negative second values with fractions must still have non-negative nanos values that count forward in time.

This field is provided for the convenience of users who may have multiple mappings to an individual which they need to track. dateOfBirth The date of birth of the individual as an ISO8601 UTC timestamp - rounded down to the closest known year/month/day/hour/minute e.g. \"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z\" for someone born on an unknown day in March 2018 or \"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z\" for someone born on an unknown day in 2018 or empty if unknown/ not stated. gender Self-identified gender karyotypicSex The karyotypic sex of the individual taxonomy NCBI taxonomic identifier NCBITaxon e.g. NCBITaxon:9606 or NCBITaxon:1337 For resources where there may be more than one organism being studied it is advisable to indicate the taxonomic identifier of that organism, to its most specific level timeAtLastEncounter An TimeElement object describing the age of the individual at the last time of collection. The Age object allows the encoding of the age either as ISO8601 duration or time interval (preferred), or as ontology term object. See http://build.fhir.org/datatypes vitalStatus Vital status of the individual. If not present it is assumed that the individual is alive. If present it will default to 'false' i.e. the individual was alive when the data was collected. ARGO mapping donor::vital_status causeOfDeath ARGO mapping donor::cause_of_death status survivalTimeInDays ARGO mapping donor::survival_time timeOfDeath created ISO8601 UTC timestamp for when this phenopacket was created in ISO \"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z\" createdBy some kind of identifier for the contributor/ program ARGO sample_registration::program_id externalReferences External identifiers for this message. These are considered different representation of the same record, not records which are in some other relation with the record at hand.

This string must contain at least one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in path/google.protobuf.Duration ). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme http , https , or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, https is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than http , https (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics. clinicalTnmFinding Cancer findings in the TNM system that is relevant to the diagnosis of cancer.

The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the Gregorian calendar backwards to year one. All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are \"smeared\" so that no leap second table is needed for interpretation, using a 24-hour linear smear . The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from RFC 3339 date strings. # Examples Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX time() . Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL)); timestamp.set_nanos(0); Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX gettimeofday() . struct timeval tv; gettimeofday(&tv, NULL); Timestamp timestamp; timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec); timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000); Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 GetSystemTimeAsFileTime() . FILETIME ft; GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft); UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) Pedigree https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/article?id=11016 Person Individual An individual (or subject) typically corresponds to an individual human or another organism.

Any contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := anypb.New(foo) if err != nil { ... } ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". JSON ==== The JSON representation of an Any value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field @type which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field value which holds the custom JSON in addition to the @type field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" } Disease Message to indicate a disease (diagnosis) and its recorded onset. Biosample A Biosample refers to a unit of biological material from which the substrate molecules (e.g. genomic DNA, RNA, proteins) for molecular analyses (e.g. sequencing, array hybridisation, mass-spectrometry) are extracted. Examples would be a tissue biopsy, a single cell from a culture for single cell genome sequencing or a protein fraction from a gradient centrifugation. Several instances (e.g. technical replicates) or types of experiments (e.g. genomic array as well as RNA-seq experiments) may refer to the same Biosample.

This string must contain at least one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in path/google.protobuf.Duration ). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme http , https , or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, https is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than http , https (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics. clinicalTnmFinding Cancer findings in the TNM system that is relevant to the diagnosis of cancer.

Any contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with a URL that describes the type of the serialized message. Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := anypb.New(foo) if err != nil { ... } ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use 'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". JSON ==== The JSON representation of an Any value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field @type which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": , \"lastName\": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field value which holds the custom JSON in addition to the @type field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]): { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration\", \"value\": \"1.212s\" } _ URI: any:Any Slots Name Range Cardinality Description Info typeUrl string 0..1 A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least one \"/\" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent the fully qualified name of the type (as in path/google.protobuf.Duration ). The name should be in a canonical form (e.g., leading \".\" is not accepted). In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the scheme http , https , or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows: * If no scheme is provided, https is assumed. * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][] value in binary format, or produce an error. * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage breaking changes.) Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with type.googleapis.com. Schemes other than http , https (or the empty scheme) might be used with implementation specific semantics. . value Value 0..1 Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type. .

Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type. Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++. Foo foo = ...; Any any; any.PackFrom(foo); ... if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) { ... } Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java. Foo foo = ...; Any any = Any.pack(foo); ... if (any.is(Foo.class)) { foo = any.unpack(Foo.class); } Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python. foo = Foo(...) any = Any() any.Pack(foo) ... if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR): any.Unpack(foo) ... Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo := &pb.Foo{...} any, err := anypb.New(foo) if err != nil { ... } ... foo := &pb.Foo{} if err := any.UnmarshalTo(foo); err != nil { ... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use '' type.googleapis.com/full.type.name '' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '' / '' in the type URL, for example \"foo.bar.com/x/y.z\" will yield type name \"y.z\". JSON ==== The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { \"@type\": \"type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person\", \"firstName\": <string>, \"lastName\": <string> } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field.
