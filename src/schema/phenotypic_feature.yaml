        description: Flag to indicate whether the phenotype was observed or not. Default is 'false', in other words the phenotype was observed. Therefore it is only required in cases to indicate that the phenotype was looked for, but found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates the logical negation of the OntologyClass used in the 'type' field. *CAUTION* It is imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the phenotype!
