## About

This is a draft for demo purposes.

It is a LinkML rendering of the Phenopackets schema. The only thing that is edited is the phenopackets.yaml file in the src/schema folder.

Various artefacts are generated:

 * Python dataclasses
 * JSON-Schema
 * GraphQL
 * ShEx
 * JSON-LD context
 * SQL DDL

Coming soon:

 * Java classes
 * ...

## Python Datamodel
